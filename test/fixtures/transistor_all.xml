<p>As mentioned in the episode, here&#8217;s a photo of my Rube Goldberg machine that I built after seeing Newton&#8217;s Dream &#8212; a large contraption of golf balls moving along tracks &#8212; at the Franklin Institute. My version is obviously a bit simpler: drop a ball from the top, and it would roll through the pipe to flip a die suspended on a pipe cleaner inside the box box.</p>

<p>Birds of a feather may flock together &#8212; but it turns out birds that live in the city sing at higher frequencies, louder, and more often than their rural friends to outmatch the noise pollution of cars and people. The din of city life is creating new divisions between bird species. Researchers like Elizabeth Derryberry are finding those high-pitched tenors of the bird world aren&#8217;t quite as attractive to mates as the lower Barry Whites of the country.</p>

<p>Over the past 20 years, there’s been a revolution in the science of arson investigations. Many of the clues that had been used for decades to determine that a fire was not accidental, especially the analysis of burn patterns on walls and floors, have been proven to be false. Reporter Michael May looks closely at two deadly fires to explore the cutting edge of fire science.</p>
<p>For more on this case, here&#8217;s Dave Mann of the <em>Texas Observer</em> on NPR&#8217;s All Things Considered last year:</p>

		<description>What does it mean when a woman commits a crime and attributes her actions to PMS? We revisit the first use of the "PMS defense," in this country, back in 1981. What have we learned about the science of PMS since then? Last year, the American Psychiatric Association classified a form of PMS (Premenstrual dysphoric disorder, or PMDD) as a mental disorder in the DSM-V. How can the scientific community study severe premenstrual symptoms without perpetuating the utterly unscientific idea that menstruating women aren’t mentally competent or liable for crimes they commit?</description>

She is one of just dozens of polio survivors who still rely on their decades-old machines. </p>
<p><em>The Last of the Iron Lungs</em> is a portrait of Martha, who contracted polio in 1953. To Martha, the 1940s iron lung is comfort and survival. As a researcher explains in the story, newer machines operate differently, forcing air into the lungs in a way that doesn&#8217;t feel right for iron lung patients.</p>
<p style="margin-top:30px;">
Producer <a href="http://www.juliascott.net/">Julia Scott</a> sent us some thoughts about her experience reporting this story:
</p>
<blockquote><p>
&#8220;Martha&#8217;s story is fascinating enough on its own. It&#8217;s a radio producer&#8217;s dream to be able to capture the kinds of sounds no one will ever hear again &#8211; the mechanical bellows, pushing air through a machine older than Martha herself. </p>
<p>&#8220;Reporting this story made me realize how distant and abstracted polio has become in our national memory. Martha&#8217;s bedroom is dominated by her iron lung, a relic of history that most people my age may never even have heard of (I&#8217;m 32). To her, it&#8217;s a trusted companion and a lifelong friend. But the iron lung symbolized one of the most terrifying, unpredictable health epidemics of the 20th century. Archival photos <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Iron_Lung_ward-Rancho_Los_Amigos_Hospital.gif">like this one</a> brought home the sheer scale of the outbreak &#8211; and the prospect of lifelong paralysis that thousands of people endured.</p>
<p>&#8220;One of the highlights of this project was being able to try out Martha&#8217;s iron lung &#8211; something I was a little scared to do. I laid down on the sliding cot, pushed my head through her foam neck collar and she sealed me in. It wasn&#8217;t claustrophobic, but I wasn&#8217;t counting on how hard it would be stop drawing breath and let the respirator take over pushing my diaphragm in and out, forcing air to whoosh into my throat. &#8216;Stop trying to breathe!&#8217; Martha instructed. For her, lying in the iron lung is the most comfortable sensation in the world. </p>
<p>&#8220;Since the story has aired I&#8217;ve received emails from people whose families were touched by polio, grandfathers and great-aunts who spent time in an iron lung but graduated to breathing on their own. They see Martha&#8217;s story as part of the same continuum.&#8221;
</p></blockquote>

<p>Some things can be better left unsaid. Who would have thought that math could be one of them?</p>
<p>Tim Chartier has found a way to fuse his two great loves: math and mime. He and his wife strive to have their audiences become a part of the world that they&#8217;re creating on stage, and in so doing, the math becomes at once understandable and unforgettable.</p>
<p><strong>Inside the Episode:</strong></p>
<p>Producer <a href="https://aridanielshapiro.wordpress.com/" target="_blank">Ari Daniel</a> gives us an inside look on pulling this story together:</p>
<blockquote><p>“The hardest thing about this story was how to bring math (a subject that most people aren’t especially fond of) and mime (a subject which, by definition, just doesn’t work without being able to see it) to life on the radio. I was fortunate that Tim is an incredible storyteller and communicator, and that he and his wife, Tanya, were so generous with their time and expertise when I visited them. In addition, my editor, Sean Cole, helped me improve this piece immensely, by focusing the storyline and adding humor and creative vitality. This piece is one of my favorites to have worked on.”</p></blockquote>
<p>After you treat your ears to math and mime, feast your eyes on a video of one of Tim Chartier’s performances. It may not be the most conventional of combinations, but the product of math and mime is nothing short of amazing.</p>

<p>In music, everything seems to have another digital life. Pianists can play with different voicings on an electric keyboard. Guitarists can filter their instrument’s signal through a pedal or amp to create various effects. Why shouldn’t violinists be able to digitally harness the sound of a Stradivarius? For starters, it takes an incredible feat of engineering to make an authentic-sounding digital violin. Radio reporter (and violinist!) <a href="http://www.quietlifemotel.com/" target="_blank">David Schulman</a> takes us to visit a top violinmaker who has been working with a physicist and two engineers to create a prototype digital violin.</p>
<p><strong>Inside the Episode:</strong></p>
<p>Scientists say the violin is one of the hardest instruments to mimic. But <a href="http://www.macfound.org/fellows/756/" target="_blank">MacArthur Award-winning violin maker Joseph Curtin</a> has been working for several years with physicist <a href="http://josephcurtinstudios.com/people/gabriel-weinreich/" target="_blank">Gabi Weinreich</a>, along with sound engineer <a href="http://josephcurtinstudios.com/people/john-bell/">John Bell</a> and industrial designer <a href="http://josephcurtinstudios.com/people/alex-sobolev/" target="_blank">Alex Sobolev</a>, to <a href="http://josephcurtinstudios.com/digital-violin/" target="_blank">create a digital violin</a>. They say its sound will be hard to tell from a recording of a Strad.</p>

<p><strong>Bonus &#8212; Meet David Schulman, the reporter of this story:</strong></p>
<p>PRX was able to ask producer/reporter David Schulman about his experience making this audio story. He says,</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;The chance to do this piece brought together several things I am deeply fascinated by &mdash; music, violins, sound-rich audio storytelling, and the nature of creativity &amp; discovery.&#8221;
</p></blockquote>
<p>Something that didn&#8217;t make the final cut of the story, which sheds more light on why a digital Stradivarius is so difficult to engineer, is </p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Weinreich&#8217;s research has shown that a violin&#8217;s sound is in fact deeply varied in the <i>spatial</i> dimension, and that, with each note, the physical power and direction of the overtones changes widely  — one likely reason why it&#8217;s hard to actually record an acoustic violin well.&#8221;
</p></blockquote>
<p>On <em>convolution</em>, the name of the technology developed for the digital Strad, David says,</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;With it&#8217;s potential for alternate aural realities, [convolution] is a richly metaphorical area for scientists, artists and storytellers [&#8230;] Imagine a situation in which  convolution impulse maps are the most vivid documentation remaining of a ransacked temple, or a lost Stradivarius.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>While he was gathering tape and doing interviews, David tells us that he was even able to play some of Curtin&#8217;s instruments, an added bonus for someone who is a musician on top of being a radio producer. Still, such an idyllic experience still was not without its challenges: </p>
<blockquote><p>
&#8220;The central challenge of the piece involved using demos to link several rich — though rather technical — ideas,and to arrive at a final comparison where you&#8217;d hear the digital Strad and an actual Strad, side by side.&#8221;
</p></blockquote>

		<itunes:subtitle>Science and violin-making meet to try to create an electric violin that sounds like a Stradavarius.</itunes:subtitle>
		<itunes:summary>In music, everything seems to have another digital, electric life. Pianists can play with different voicings on an electric keyboard. Guitarists can filter their instrument’s signal through a pedal or amp to create various effects. Why shouldn’t violinists be able to digitally harness the sound of a Stradivarius? For starters, it takes an incredible feat of engineering to capture the authentic sound of a violin. David Schulman takes us to visit a top violinmaker who has been working with a physicist and two engineers to create a prototype digital violin.</itunes:summary>

<p><strong>A story of movement, memory, and mentors.</strong> <a href="http://transistor.prx.org/about-our-hosts/#wendy" target="_blank">Dr. Wendy Suzuki</a> introduces us to <a href="https://ib.berkeley.edu/people/faculty/profiles/more/mdiamond.php" target="_blank">Dr. Marian Diamond</a>, whose lively classes ushered Wendy into a career in neuroscience. And Wendy shares how she came to study how exercise profoundly affects the brain, not just the body.</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s more from Wendy:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A science mentor can make your career. Dr. Marian Diamond not only ushered me into the field of neuroscience with her lively and engaging classes but she has continued to influence me and help me throughout my work as a scientist and teacher.    </p>
<p>What made Marian such a profound mentor? Her multi-dimensionality. First, she was the best teacher I have ever experienced in my entire thirty-year career, unendingly fascinated with her specialty, human anatomy, including both brain anatomy and gross human anatomy. Now, if you have never taken an anatomy course before, you should know it can be as dry as learning last year’s tax laws. Marian made anatomy come alive, relating every brain or body part to a question or observation about ourselves, such as “The word uterus means Hysterical- do you agree with this?”  Or “Do you know what the largest organ in the body is? It’s your skin- take care of it!” She made anatomy relevant and personal.  </p>
<p>Second, she made groundbreaking scientific contributions on the capacity of the brain to change in response to the environment. When she did this work in the late 1950s/early 1960s, nobody believed that the adult brain could change – at least in any ways that scientists could measure.  Marian and her colleagues showed that changing a rat’s living space (what she called “enriching” the environment) could have profound effects of the brain’s anatomy and that she could measure them. In this episode, I’ll describe Marian’s pioneering studies and how they related to recent studies showing the profound ways that exercise transforms the brain. </p>
<p>Third, she offered me a role model of a thriving, engaged and enthusiastic female scientist, even if it took me years to appreciate how lucky I was. You see, she was such a powerful presence on the Berkeley campus that I thought that smart strong, successful female neuroscientists who were extraordinary teachers were everywhere! I never questioned whether I would be able to do the same thing, because she showed me that it could be done. Only much later into my post-doctoral studies did I notice that other female scientists didn’t seem to have the same confidence that I did; they saw the sea of men in science with only a few successful women and many found it discouraging.</p>
<p>Only later was I able to fully appreciate what a wonderful gift she gave me as my role model in science.  Because Marian did the work she loved, she allowed me to sail right over worries over whether a woman could make it. </p>
<p>In this episode, we’ll hear from Marian herself, as she teaches a class and describes her groundbreaking findings. Her work on brain plasticity is at the heart of the work that I and many neuroscientists pursue today.</p>
<p>&#8212; Dr. Wendy Suzuki</p>

<p>In this episode, biologist <a href="http://transistor.prx.org/about-our-hosts/#christina" target="_blank">Christina Agapakis</a> explores ways these blind spots, especially around gender and sexism, have affected research and women’s careers in science. She talks with one of her heroes, anthropologist <a href="http://anthropology.as.nyu.edu/object/emilymartin.html" target="_blank">Emily Martin</a>, and her husband, biophysicist <a href="http://biophysics.jhu.edu/faculty-pages/cone.html" target="_blank">Richard Cone</a>, <img src="http://transistor.prx.org/wp-content/uploads/Richard_Cone_Photo.jpg" style="float:right; margin-left:20px;border:1px solid rgb(201, 201, 201);" width="125">about Emily&#8217;s 1991 article &#8220;<a href="http://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/3174586?uid=3739832&#038;uid=2129&#038;uid=2&#038;uid=70&#038;uid=4&#038;uid=3739256&#038;sid=21106402642431#page_scan_tab_contents" target="_blank">The Egg &#038; The Sperm</a>.&#8221; Reading that article about the ways cultural romantic assumptions limited scientists’ understanding of human reproduction was a turning point for Christina as a young scientist who considered her feminism as something separate from science. </p>
<div style="float:right;"><img src="http://transistor.prx.org/wp-content/uploads/Kate-Clancy_Image.jpeg" style="float:right; margin-left:20px;border:1px solid rgb(201, 201, 201);"><br /><span style="font-size:11px;float:right;">Kate Clancy</span></div>
<p>She also talks with anthropologist <a href="https://twitter.com/kateclancy" target="_blank">Kate Clancy</a> who has spent a lot of time thinking and writing about the ways women’s careers in science are different from men’s. Kate offers some thoughts on what science needs to consider to truly bring in more underrepresented voices and perspectives. New perspectives and voices in science may be key to science seeing blind spots for the first time. </p>

But now, three decades later, science is reconsidering.</p>
<p>His discovery came on the heels of the book <em>The Secret Life of Plants</em>, which claimed plants were sentient, emotional creatures with the ability to communicate telepathically with humans. It was a huge bestseller and Rhoades&#8217; experiments sounded like they were straight from the book. His work was criticized, grant funding disappeared, and he eventually left science.</p>
<p>Today, however, Rhoades&#8217; experiments have been replicated, and his theories confirmed. Scientists have found evidence that plants not only communicate with each other but also acknowledge kin, respond to sound waves, and share resources through networks of underground fungi.</p>

<p>Your skin is your largest organ and is also is a thriving ecosystem, covered in bacteria. While many of us consider regular showers key to keeping our skin healthy, a group of scientists &#8212; and artists &#8212; are starting to ask: Could the future of skin care not be soap, but bacteria?</p>
<p><strong>Inside the Episode</strong></p>
<p>Biologist Christina Agapakis visits <a href="http://mist.aobiome.com/" target="_blank">AOBiome</a> in Cambridge, Mass. to talk with <a href="https://www.aobiome.com/our-team" target="_blank">the team</a> there that has developed a bacterial mist you spritz on your skin several times a day instead of showering.</p>

<p>Then, it&#8217;s off to rethink one of the most common skin problems, pimples. We meet Noa Kaplan, who makes <a href="http://www.noapkaplan.com/atopic" target="_blank">sculptures based from ultra-magnified shots of her pores</a>.</p>

<p><img src="http://transistor.prx.org/wp-content/uploads/IMG_9446.jpg"><span style="font-size:11px;">&copy;Noa Kaplan</span></p>
<p>We also explore how fabric could support our skin&#8217;s ecosystem. Fashion futurist <a href="http://www.biocouture.co.uk/" target="_blank">Suzanne Lee</a> talks about the not-too-distant future when our clothes may do more than just cover us – they may be made from living bacteria and designed to interact with our skin. Check out this <a href="http://trendland.com/suzanne-lee-and-her-celluloid-clothing/" target="_blank">article about Suzanne&#8217;s process</a>, and <a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/suzanne_lee_grow_your_own_clothes" target="_blank">her TED Talk</a>.</p>

And some space telescopes allow astronomers to see light that is billions of years old and existed before there was an Earth or sun. Astrophysicist Michelle Thaller introduces us to scientists who started two of the most powerful telescopes, the Hubble, which launched 25 years ago, and the James Webb Space Telescope, being built right now.</p>
<p><strong>Inside the Episode:</strong></p>
<p>Dr. Michelle Thaller speaks with <a href="http://women.nasa.gov/nancy-grace-roman/" target="_blank">Nancy Grace Roman</a>, the first Head of Astrophysics at NASA, about how she got interested in the stars and her time working at NASA on the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hubble_Space_Telescope" target="_blank">Hubble Space Telescope</a>. </p>
<p>Then, Dr. Thaller meets with <a href="http://www.janerigby.net/" target="_blank">Jane Rigby</a>, Deputy Operations Project Scientist for <a href="http://www.jwst.nasa.gov/" target="_blank">The James Webb Space Telescope,</a> the next generation of space telescope, launching in 2018. Its mirror will be seven times the size of Hubble&#8217;s and will help astronomers see farther than they&#8217;ve ever seen before. Here are some photos of their visit:</p>
<p><img src="http://transistor.prx.org/wp-content/uploads/photo-1.jpg" style="float:right;"><br />
Drs. Michelle Thaller (L) and Jane Rigby look into the clean room where NASA is building the James Webb Space Telescope. This six-story room is the largest clean room in the world.</p>
<p><img src="http://transistor.prx.org/wp-content/uploads/MichelleandJane.jpg" width="500"><br />
Drs. Jane Rigby (L) and Michelle Thaller gaze up at a giant piece of machinery at NASA&#8217;s Goddard Space Flight Center that will be used to test the James Webb Space Telescope before its launch in 2018.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><script id='prx-p145879-embed' src='https://www.prx.org/p/145879/embed.js?size=small'></script><br />
<img class="aligncenter  wp-image-11258" alt="Dining Room 2" src="http://blog.prx.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Dining-Room-2-1024x610.jpg" width="300" style="float:right;margin-left:20px;" />In the fall of 1902, twelve young men in suits regularly gathered for dinners in the basement of a government building in Washington, D.C. The men ate what they were served, even though they knew that their food was spiked with poison. The mastermind behind these experiments was Harvey Washington Wiley. Before you condemn him, though, you’d be surprised to know that you probably owe him a debt of gratitude. Incidentally, Wiley is the founding father of the Food and Drug Administration.</p>
<p><strong>Inside the Episode:</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://blog.prx.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/PoisonSquadLogo.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-11261 alignright" style="margin-right: 5px; margin-left: 5px;margin-left:20px;" alt="PoisonSquadLogo" src="http://blog.prx.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/PoisonSquadLogo-300x165.jpg" width="300"  /></a>The intention of these experiments was not to induce digestive discomfort for its own sake. Rather, they were part of an extensive study on how chemical preservatives in food &#8212; before regulations existed &#8212; could harm human beings over time. You might cringe at what was once used to keep food &#8220;fresh.&#8221;</p>
<p>Producer <strong><a href="http://sruthiriedl.com/" target="_blank">Sruthi Pinnamaneni</a></strong> gave us a closer look inside the story. About diving deep into archival materials, she says,</p>
<blockquote><p>
&#8220;I spent hours [at the Library of Congress], reading thousands of [Wiley&#8217;s] letters and squinting at his tiny journals.  It is when you know every curve and squiggle of a man&#8217;s handwriting that you feel as though you&#8217;re starting to get to know him!&#8221;
</p></blockquote>
<p>One surprising fact that she discovered while researching the piece was that while Wiley&#8217;s experiments contributed so much to food regulation, today&#8217;s practices still leave something to be desired:</p>
<blockquote><p>
&#8220;&#8230;The FDA doesn&#8217;t really test food additives anymore.  There are more than five thousand additives commonly found in processed food and most of them haven&#8217;t been tested on animals and almost none (except for dietary supplements) have been tested on humans.&#8221;

		<itunes:summary>In the fall of 1902, twelve young men in suits regularly gathered for dinners in the basement of a government building in Washington, D.C. The men ate what they were served, even though they knew that their food was spiked with poison. The mastermind behind these experiments was Harvey Washington Wiley. Before you condemn him, though, you’d be surprised to know that you probably owe him a debt of gratitude. Incidentally, Wiley is the founding father of the Food and Drug Administration.</itunes:summary>

Many depictions of amnesia in TV, movies, and cartoons are just plain wrong &#8212; some laughably so. </p>
<div style="margin-left:20px;float:right;margin-bottom:20px;">
<img src="http://transistor.prx.org/wp-content/uploads/amnesia.jpg" style="float:right;" width="275"><br /><span style="float:right;font-size:12px;"><em>Futurama</em></span></div>
<p>Host <a href="http://transistor.prx.org/about-our-hosts/#wendy" target="blank">Dr.Wendy Suzuki</a> talks with <a href="http://msl.beckman.illinois.edu/people" target="_blank">Prof. Neal Cohen</a>, a Neuroscientist from the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign.  For 20 years, Neal has used bad examples of amnesia that abound in pop culture as well as the rare accurate depictions as a powerful tool in his wildly popular undergraduate course about amnesia in pop culture.  Neal entertains and educates his students with examples from TV shows and films as diverse as <em>Futurama, Memento</em>, and <em>50 First Dates</em>, and we&#8217;ll hear some of those clips.</p>
<p><strong>Inside the Episode:</strong></p>
<div style="float:right;margin-bottom:20px;"><img src="http://transistor.prx.org/wp-content/uploads/neal-cohen-m.jpg" width="250" style="margin-left:20px;float:right;border:1px solid rgb(201, 201, 201);"><br /><span style="font-size:11px;float:right;">Neal Cohen</span></div>
<p>Wendy and Neal illuminate some of the core features that define true amnesia, and discuss a classic finding that Neal published early in his career with Prof. Larry Squire, another expert on memory. They made the key distinction between “knowing how” and “knowing that.” </p>
<p>Most amnesic patients can’t learn or remember that particular things happened in at a particular time or in a particular place.  In fact, patients with severe amnesia are no longer able to learn or remember anything about what has happened to them.  However, Neal Cohen and Larry Squire showed that the same amnesic patients could learn and remember <em>how</em> to do things, like work a lock, or solve a puzzle with blocks, or swing a racquet.  Thus, they could learn and remember <em>how</em> to do things, but not that those things <em>had happened</em>.   </p>
<p>At the end of every class, Neal asks his students to write their own short screenplay about a character with amnesia. If you feel inspired after listening to the episode, send us an amnesia screenplay synopsis in the <a href=" http://transistor.prx.org/2015/03/totally-cerebral-amnesia#comments">comments section</a>!</p>

Everybody knows about white noise &#8212; that sound that comes out of your TV when it&#8217;s not working quite right. But there are many other colors of noise, too: pink, brown, blue, and purple. Marnie Chesterton brings us this story on the colorful science of sound.</p>
<p>Play with your own noisy rainbow &mdash; and learn more about each color &mdash; by clicking here:</p>
<p><a href="http://noise.marniechesterton.com/"><img src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/production.mediajoint.prx.org/public/piece_images/306548/Screen_Shot_2014-08-26_at_12.59.35_PM.png"></a></p>
<p><strong>Inside the Episode:</strong></p>
<p>We meet Shelley, who uses pink noise to drown out the constant ringing in her head (tinnitus); Professor <a href="http://www.salford.ac.uk/computing-science-engineering/cse-academics/trevor-cox">Trevor Cox at the Acoustic Engineering group at Salford</a> explains why engineers need to classify different frequencies this way; and <a href="http://www.cyrusshahrad.com/hiatus-music/">Cyrus Shahrad, electronic music producer</a>, whose love of brown noise filters through into his work. </p>
<div style="float:right;"><a href="http://transistor.prx.org/wp-content/uploads/marnie_in_rain.jpg"><img src="http://transistor.prx.org/wp-content/uploads/marnie_in_rain1.jpg" style="float:right;margin-left:20px;border:1px solid rgb(201, 201, 201);" width="270"></a><br /><span style="font-size:11px;float:right;">Producer/reporter Marnie Chesterton</span></div>
<p>We asked Marnie how she got interested in making a story about the science of sound.</p>
<p>She tells us that she came across this story idea after having heard about pink noise. She began an investigation sparked by her own curiosity about the spectrum of sound: “I started unpicking the stories of different colours of sound, mainly by talking about this topic to everyone I could think of,” she recounts. “After a few chats with various academics, I came to Professor Trevor Cox, an acoustic engineer at Salford University, who is obsessed with qualities of sound – reverb, echo.&#8221;</p>
<div style="float:right;"><img src="http://transistor.prx.org/wp-content/uploads/trevorcox.jpeg" style="float:right;margin-left:20px;border:1px solid rgb(201, 201, 201);" width="150"><br /><span style="font-size:11px;float:right;">Prof. Trevor Cox</span></div>
<p>Through Trevor Cox, Chesterson got a first-hand look at an anechoic chamber, a whole room constructed to deaden any type of sound whatsoever. She describes the room as the most bizarre one she&#8217;s been in for a while: “The walls and ceiling are covered with these meter-long, dark grey foam spikes, and the floor, if you can call it that, is a mesh a bit like that of a trampoline. Through the holes in the floor, I could see down into darkness, maybe more foam spikes.”</p>
<p>Imagine a room that is so silent that the sounds seem to come from your own head. Chesterson explains, “The brain’s response to that kind of silence is to fill it with something, anything. And that’s what tinnitus is.”</p>
<p>If you’re interested in exploring the different bands of sound described in Chesterson’s story, you can <a href="http://noise.marniechesterton.com/" target="_blank">play with the companion interactive rainbow of noise</a>. Listen to which bands are used to treat tinnitus, to describe regime shifts in climate, to help sirens cut through background noise, and more.</p>

<p>For one disease, poop &mdash; yes, human poop &mdash; is nothing short a miracle cure. Microbiologist Christina Agapakis takes a look at Fecal Microbiota Transplants or FMT and what happens when you take the really complex gut microbiome from a healthy person and transplant it into the gut of a really sick person. For patients suffering from a one of the most common and deadly hospital acquired infections, <em>Clostridium Difficile</em>, or C Diff, one poop transplant can cure them, sometimes within hours. But, why? </p>

<p>Christina visits Mark Smith at  <a href="http://www.openbiome.org/" target="_blank">OpenBiome</a> in Medford, Massachusetts. OpenBiome is a poop bank where donors are paid $40 bucks a po(o)p and where scientists like Mark produce highly screened, liquefied poop samples to be sent to doctors and hospitals all over the country. </p>
<p>Christina talks with Ed Yong, blogger at <a href="http://phenomena.nationalgeographic.com/blog/not-exactly-rocket-science/" target="_blank">Not Exactly Rocket Science</a> and author of a forthcoming book about microbes called <em><a href="http://www.janklowandnesbit.co.uk/ed-yong/i-contain-multitudes" target="_blank">I Contain Multitudes</a></em>, about what we might be failing to ask in all of the excitement surrounding FMT. </p>
<p>Christina also talks with <a href="https://twitter.com/contaminatedsci" target="_blank">Tami Lieberman</a>, a systems biologist at Harvard who decided to put some new home sampling kits for sequencing your gut microbiome to the test. </p>
<p>It’s a wild and wooly world out there when it comes to the medical power of poop. Who knew? Stay tuned. </p>

<ul>
<li>It takes longer for Venus to rotate once on its axis than it does to make one trip around the sun. Meaning that <em>Venus&#8217; days are longer than its years</em>.</li>
<li style="margin-top:3px;">After the moon, Venus is the brightest natural object in the sky.</li>
<li style="margin-top:3px;">It rains sulphuric acid on Venus.</li>
<li style="margin-top:3px;">Venus&#8217; atmospheric pressure is 92 times what it is on Earth, which is enough to crush a human flat.</li>
<li style="margin-top:3px;">Surface temperatures on Venus can get up to 880 degrees Fahrenheit.</li>
<li style="margin-top:3px;">Venus boasts tens of thousands of volcanoes on its surface.</li>

<p>Imagine that every time you met someone new, the moment they left the room you forgot you had ever spoken to them, and when they returned it was as if you had never seen them before.  Imagine remembering your childhood, your parents, the history you learned in school, but never being able to form a new long term memory after the age of 27.  </p>
<p>Welcome to the life of the famous amnesic patient &#8220;HM&#8221;, who had experimental surgery to relieve his terrible epilepsy, and woke up with a profound memory impairment.  Neuroscientist Suzanne Corkin studied HM for almost half a century, and considered him a friend, even though he could never remember how he knew her.  Suzanne gives us a glimpse of what daily life was like for him, and his tremendous contribution to our understanding of how our memories work.</p>
<p><strong>Inside the Episode</strong></p>
<p>For 50 years, Patient HM’s true identity was hidden from the public, but when he died in 2008 we learned his name was Henry Moliason.  We hear him speak in this episode, and talk about his cheerful willingness to undergo test after test (though once they were finished, he couldn’t remember ever having done them) in order to help others.  </p>

In her <em>Totally Cerebral</em> episodes on <em>Transistor</em>, <a href="http://transistor.prx.org/about-our-hosts/#wendy">neuroscientist Wendy Suzuki</a> <strong>introduces us to scientists who have uncovered some of the deepest secrets about how our brains make us who we are</strong>.  </p>

<p><strong>Wendy begins by talking with groundbreaking experimental psychologist Brenda Milner</strong></strong>, who in the 1950s, completely changed our understanding of the parts of the brain important for forming new long-term memories. Through her observation and careful study of patients with profound amnesia, Brenda wrote a paper in 1957 that broke with the accepted theories about memory, and blew open the entire field of neuroscience.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.mcgill.ca/about/history/mcgill-pioneers/milner">Brenda Milner</a> was born in 1918, and she is still working and using the same wooden chair in her office at McGill University in Montreal, where she wrote her pioneering paper on HM and memory. In fact, if you listen carefully in the episode you may hear the faint squeak of her wooden desk chair, which she has used for more than 50 years. Brenda has received numerous prizes for her work, including the Kavli Prize in 2014.</p>

<p>In her episodes of <em>Transistor</em>, <a href="http://transistor.prx.org/about-our-hosts#christina">biologist Christina Agapakis</a> is <strong>exploring the microbiome: the trillions of bacteria, fungi, and viruses that live in and on our body</strong>. The microbiome is hot right now and in these episodes Christina will explore what we do know in the face of so much hope and hype.</p>
<p><strong>She starts with food.</strong> Bacteria-rich foods such as tempeh, cheese, pickles and yogurt have long been praised for their probiotic effect. But can you really add enough good bacteria to your digestive system to outnumber the bad? </p>
<p><strong>Inside the Episode:</strong></p>
<div style="float:right;margin-bottom:20px;"><img src="http://transistor.prx.org/wp-content/uploads/IMG_8196.jpg" style="float:right;margin-left:30px;margin-bottom:20px;" width="250"><br /><span style="font-size:11px;float:right;">Barry&#8217;s business partner Gordon Bennett<br /> mixing the <em>Rhizopus</em> culture into the soybeans.</span></div>
<p>Christina pays a visit to an industrial kitchen in Long Island City, Queens, where Barry Schwartz and a small team meet up every other week to make Barry&#8217;s Tempeh, <a href="http://growninbrooklyn.com/" target="_blank">the only fresh tempeh sold in New York State</a>.</p>
<p>Wanting to better understand tempeh – aka &#8220;blue cheese of tofu&#8221; – Christina then calls her friend <a href="http://uci.academia.edu/ColinCahill" target="_blank">Colin Cahill</a> in Indonesia where tempeh originated. He explains how it&#8217;s more than just soybeans and fungus that give tempeh in Indonesia its regional flavor.</p>
<p>Then, if a single bacteria food like tempeh is good, studying a more complex ecosystem like the bacteria on cheese rind might tell us more about bacteria interact with each other and in our digestive systems – at least that&#8217;s <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/theduttonlab/" target="_blank">Harvard biologist Rachel Dutton</a>&#8216;s goal. She&#8217;s studied more than a hundred different types of cheese from around the world, trying to better understand how cheese gets its flavor and why they are all so different. She&#8217;s now the go-to biologist for world-famous chefs like David Chang of Momufuko and Jim Lahey of Sullivan Street Bakery in New York, helping them explore ways to make foods taste new, different and better.</p>
<p>Christina then shares her early love of fermentation with fermentation revivalist <a href="http://www.wildfermentation.com/who-is-sandorkraut/" target="_blank">Sandor Katz</a>. Sandor&#8217;s never met a fermented food he didn&#8217;t like, but he&#8217;s skeptical of anyone who says fermented foods can make us healthy on their own.</p>
