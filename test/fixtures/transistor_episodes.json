Through her observation and careful study of patients with profound amnesia, Brenda wrote a paper in 1957 that broke with the accepted theories about memory, and blew open the entire field of neuroscience.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Inside the Episode</strong></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://transistor.prx.org/wp-content/uploads/shutterstock_235279540.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"http://transistor.prx.org/wp-content/uploads/shutterstock_235279540.jpg\"></a></p>\n\n<p>The brain!

In fact, if you listen carefully in the episode you may hear the faint squeak of her wooden desk chair, which she has used for more than 50 years. Brenda has received numerous prizes for her work, including the Kavli Prize in 2014.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://transistor.prx.org/wp-content/uploads/HM_in-front-of-house.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"http://transistor.prx.org/wp-content/uploads/HM_in-front-of-house.jpg\"></a><br><br>\nHM as a young man</p>\n\n<p>Patient HM is perhaps the most famous amnesic patient in history.

Through her observation and careful study of patients with profound amnesia, Brenda wrote a paper in 1957 that broke with the accepted theories about memory, and blew open the entire field of neuroscience.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Inside the Episode</strong></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://transistor.prx.org/wp-content/uploads/shutterstock_235279540.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"http://transistor.prx.org/wp-content/uploads/shutterstock_235279540.jpg\"></a></p>\n\n<p>The brain!

In fact, if you listen carefully in the episode you may hear the faint squeak of her wooden desk chair, which she has used for more than 50 years. Brenda has received numerous prizes for her work, including the Kavli Prize in 2014.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://transistor.prx.org/wp-content/uploads/HM_in-front-of-house.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"http://transistor.prx.org/wp-content/uploads/HM_in-front-of-house.jpg\"></a><br><br>\nHM as a young man</p>\n\n<p>Patient HM is perhaps the most famous amnesic patient in history.
