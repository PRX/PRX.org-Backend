She is one of just dozens of polio survivors who still rely on their decades-old machines.</p>\n\n<p><em>The Last of the Iron Lungs</em> is a portrait of Martha, who contracted polio in 1953. To Martha, the 1940s iron lung is comfort and survival.

She began an investigation sparked by her own curiosity about the spectrum of sound: “I started unpicking the stories of different colours of sound, mainly by talking about this topic to everyone I could think of,” she recounts. “After a few chats with various academics, I came to Professor Trevor Cox, an acoustic engineer at Salford University, who is obsessed with qualities of sound – reverb, echo.”</p>\n\n<p><img src="http://transistor.prx.org/wp-content/uploads/trevorcox.jpeg"><br><br>\nProf. Trevor Cox</p>\n\n<p>Through Trevor Cox, Chesterson got a first-hand look at an anechoic chamber, a whole room constructed to deaden any type of sound whatsoever. She describes the room as the most bizarre one she’s been in for a while: “The walls and ceiling are covered with these meter-long, dark grey foam spikes, and the floor, if you can call it that, is a mesh a bit like that of a trampoline. Through the holes in the floor, I could see down into darkness, maybe more foam spikes.”</p>\n\n<p>Imagine a room that is so silent that the sounds seem to come from your own head. Chesterson explains, “The brain’s response to that kind of silence is to fill it with something, anything. And that’s what tinnitus is.”</p>\n\n<p>If you’re interested in exploring the different bands of sound described in Chesterson’s story, you can <a href="http://noise.marniechesterton.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">play with the companion interactive rainbow of noise</a>.

She began an investigation sparked by her own curiosity about the spectrum of sound: “I started unpicking the stories of different colours of sound, mainly by talking about this topic to everyone I could think of,” she recounts. “After a few chats with various academics, I came to Professor Trevor Cox, an acoustic engineer at Salford University, who is obsessed with qualities of sound – reverb, echo.”</p>\n\n<p><img src="http://transistor.prx.org/wp-content/uploads/trevorcox.jpeg"><br><br>\nProf. Trevor Cox</p>\n\n<p>Through Trevor Cox, Chesterson got a first-hand look at an anechoic chamber, a whole room constructed to deaden any type of sound whatsoever. She describes the room as the most bizarre one she’s been in for a while: “The walls and ceiling are covered with these meter-long, dark grey foam spikes, and the floor, if you can call it that, is a mesh a bit like that of a trampoline. Through the holes in the floor, I could see down into darkness, maybe more foam spikes.”</p>\n\n<p>Imagine a room that is so silent that the sounds seem to come from your own head. Chesterson explains, “The brain’s response to that kind of silence is to fill it with something, anything. And that’s what tinnitus is.”</p>\n\n<p>If you’re interested in exploring the different bands of sound described in Chesterson’s story, you can <a href="http://noise.marniechesterton.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">play with the companion interactive rainbow of noise</a>.

But can you really add enough good bacteria to your digestive system to outnumber the bad?</p>\n\n<p><strong>Inside the Episode:</strong></p>\n\n<p><img src="http://transistor.prx.org/wp-content/uploads/IMG_8196.jpg"><br><br>\nBarry’s business partner Gordon Bennett<br><br>\n mixing the <em>Rhizopus</em> culture into the soybeans.</p>\n\n<p>Christina pays a visit to an industrial kitchen in Long Island City, Queens, where Barry Schwartz and a small team meet up every other week to make Barry’s Tempeh, <a href="http://growninbrooklyn.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">the only fresh tempeh sold in New York State</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Wanting to better understand tempeh – aka “blue cheese of tofu” – Christina then calls her friend <a href="http://uci.academia.edu/ColinCahill" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Colin Cahill</a> in Indonesia where tempeh originated. He explains how it’s more than just soybeans and fungus that give tempeh in Indonesia its regional flavor.</p>\n\n<p>Then, if a single bacteria food like tempeh is good, studying a more complex ecosystem like the bacteria on cheese rind might tell us more about bacteria interact with each other and in our digestive systems – at least that’s <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/theduttonlab/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Harvard biologist Rachel Dutton</a>‘s goal. She’s studied more than a hundred different types of cheese from around the world, trying to better understand how cheese gets its flavor and why they are all so different. She’s now the go-to biologist for world-famous chefs like David Chang of Momufuko and Jim Lahey of Sullivan Street Bakery in New York, helping them explore ways to make foods taste new, different and better.</p>\n\n<p>Christina then shares her early love of fermentation with fermentation revivalist <a href="http://www.wildfermentation.com/who-is-sandorkraut/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Sandor Katz</a>. Sandor’s never met a fermented food he didn’t like, but he’s skeptical of anyone who says fermented foods can make us healthy on their own.</p>\n\n<p><em>This episode was produced by <a href="http://transistor.prx.org/about-our-producers#kerry" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Kerry Donahue</a> and Sruthi Pinnamaneni, and mixed by Tim Einenkel.</em></p>	["Christina Agapakis","Podcast"]	f	f	\N	\N	\N	f	2017-03-14 15:35:08	2015020220_99c10d00fa_food meet fungus

Her multi-dimensionality. First, she was the best teacher I have ever experienced in my entire thirty-year career, unendingly fascinated with her specialty, human anatomy, including both brain anatomy and gross human anatomy. Now, if you have never taken an anatomy course before, you should know it can be as dry as learning last year’s tax laws. Marian made anatomy come alive, relating every brain or body part to a question or observation about ourselves, such as “The word uterus means Hysterical- do you agree with this?” Or “Do you know what the largest organ in the body is? It’s your skin- take care of it!” She made anatomy relevant and personal.</p>\n\n<p>Second, she made groundbreaking scientific contributions on the capacity of the brain to change in response to the environment. When she did this work in the late 1950s/early 1960s, nobody believed that the adult brain could change – at least in any ways that scientists could measure. Marian and her colleagues showed that changing a rat’s living space (what she called “enriching” the environment) could have profound effects of the brain’s anatomy and that she could measure them. In this episode, I’ll describe Marian’s pioneering studies and how they related to recent studies showing the profound ways that exercise transforms the brain.</p>\n\n<p>Third, she offered me a role model of a thriving, engaged and enthusiastic female scientist, even if it took me years to appreciate how lucky I was. You see, she was such a powerful presence on the Berkeley campus that I thought that smart strong, successful female neuroscientists who were extraordinary teachers were everywhere! I never questioned whether I would be able to do the same thing, because she showed me that it could be done. Only much later into my post-doctoral studies did I notice that other female scientists didn’t seem to have the same confidence that I did; they saw the sea of men in science with only a few successful women and many found it discouraging.</p>\n\n<p>Only later was I able to fully appreciate what a wonderful gift she gave me as my role model in science. Because Marian did the work she loved, she allowed me to sail right over worries over whether a woman could make it.</p>\n\n<p>In this episode, we’ll hear from Marian herself, as she teaches a class and describes her groundbreaking findings.

The men ate what they were served, even though they knew that their food was spiked with poison. The mastermind behind these experiments was Harvey Washington Wiley. Before you condemn him, though, you’d be surprised to know that you probably owe him a debt of gratitude. Incidentally, Wiley is the founding father of the Food and Drug Administration.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Inside the Episode:</strong></p>\n\n<p><a href="http://blog.prx.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/PoisonSquadLogo.jpg" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="http://blog.prx.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/PoisonSquadLogo-300x165.jpg" alt="PoisonSquadLogo"></a>The intention of these experiments was not to induce digestive discomfort for its own sake. Rather, they were part of an extensive study on how chemical preservatives in food — before regulations existed — could harm human beings over time. You might cringe at what was once used to keep food “fresh.”</p>\n\n<p>Producer <strong><a href="http://sruthiriedl.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Sruthi Pinnamaneni</a></strong> gave us a closer look inside the story. About diving deep into archival materials, she says,</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>“I spent hours [at the Library of Congress], reading thousands of [Wiley’s] letters and squinting at his tiny journals.  It is when you know every curve and squiggle of a man’s handwriting that you feel as though you’re starting to get to know him!”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>One surprising fact that she discovered while researching the piece was that while Wiley’s experiments contributed so much to food regulation, today’s practices still leave something to be desired:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>“…The FDA doesn’t really test food additives anymore.  There are more than five thousand additives commonly found in processed food and most of them haven’t been tested on animals and almost none (except for dietary supplements) have been tested on humans.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Sruthi sent us some photographs of the Poison Squad, Wiley, and some (how shall I put this?) <em>unconventional</em> tools that were used during the experiments.</p>\n\n<p><a href="http://blog.prx.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/WilliamCarterwithWileyandPoisonSquad.jpg" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="http://blog.prx.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/WilliamCarterwithWileyandPoisonSquad-1024x760.jpg" alt="WilliamCarterwithWileyandPoisonSquad"></a>William Carter with Wiley and the Poison Squad</p>\n\n<p> </p>\n\n<p><a href="http://blog.prx.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Wiley-Lab.jpg" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="http://blog.prx.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Wiley-Lab.jpg" alt="Wiley Lab"></a>Wiley in his lab</p>\n\n<p> </p>\n\n<p><a href="http://blog.prx.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Lettershowinginterestinparticipating.jpg" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="http://blog.prx.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Lettershowinginterestinparticipating-1024x564.jpg" alt="Lettershowinginterestinparticipating"></a>A letter showing interest in participating</p>\n\n<p> </p>\n\n<p><a href="http://blog.prx.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/FecalDryingMachine.jpg" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="http://blog.prx.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/FecalDryingMachine.jpg" alt="FecalDryingMachine"></a>A fecal drying machine</p>\n\n<p>“None but the brave can eat the fare.” Are you brave enough?
